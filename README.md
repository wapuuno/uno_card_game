This is a boilerplate for writing apps in UNO GAME PHP. It uses Composer to install [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).  It also links to a [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) for CSS Styling, as well as a [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/) link for added functionality with JS.

###Use and Editing

1. Download and Extract the compressed file into the directory you'd like your project to live in. <br />
2. Load the project folder into your text editor. <br />
3. Start PHP in the web folder of the project directory. <br />
4. CODE! *Take care to change the names of the files in src, tests, and views, as well as the root folder to match your project* <br />
